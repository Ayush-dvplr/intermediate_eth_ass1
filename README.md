# Error Handling in Solidity

This project explores error handling in Solidity, focusing on require(), revert(), and assert(). These functions are vital for ensuring robust and reliable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- require(): Used for input validation and precondition checks, ensuring certain conditions are met before proceeding.
- revert(): Handles exceptions by reverting transactions, undoing state changes, and providing error messages.
- assert(): Used for internal error checking, catching programming errors and ensuring invariants hold true.




## Lessons Learned

- Input Validation: require() ensures inputs and preconditions are valid, preventing errors and vulnerabilities.

- Exception Handling: revert() manages exceptions by reverting transactions and providing error messages.

- Contract Integrity: assert() checks internal errors and enforces invariants, catching bugs in contract logic.

- Gas Efficiency: Understanding gas implications of error handling helps design more efficient contracts.

- Security and Reliability: Robust error handling with require(), revert(), and assert() enhances contract security and reliability.
